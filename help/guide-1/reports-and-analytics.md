# Reports and Analytics end-of-life notice

Effective January 17, 2024, Adobe has discontinued Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. At that time, Reports & Analytics and all of its reports and schedules stopped working. The reports, visualizations and underlying technology that power Reports & Analytics no longer meet Adobe's technology standards. Most Reports & Analytics features are available within Analysis Workspace. For information about using reports in Analysis Workspace, see [Use pre-built reports](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/reports/use-reports.html).

Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, Reports & Analytics functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This end-of-life announcement](https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/WFCyq7w8kijmB?) explains the end-of-life process.
