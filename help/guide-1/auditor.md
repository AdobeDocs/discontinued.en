# [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Auditor] overview {#adobe-experience-cloud-auditor}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Auditor] was a system that allowed you to generate reports that grade your [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] implementation and give pointers on how to improve it. [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Auditor] has reached end-of-life (EOL) and is no longer active.

While the standalone system has been decommissioned, you can still run all [!DNL Auditor] tests using the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Debugger] browser extension instead. For more information, please refer to the [Experience Platform Debugger documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/debugger/using-v2/experience-cloud-debugger.html).
