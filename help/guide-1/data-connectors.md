# End-of-life for Adobe Data Connectors integrations

**Effective August 19, 2021**, Adobe has discontinued Data Connectors integrations and replaced it with the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/experiencecloud.analytics.html#product). Adobe intends to make the transition as seamless as possible for customers and partners.

Adobe Analytics aims to provide the best-in-class web and marketing analytics to meet customers' needs. As technology and business needs evolve, Adobe strives to continually deliver and meet the highest standards. The APIs that power Data Connectors integrations no longer meet those standards and are not tenable in Adobe's modern technology infrastructure.

Note that this end-of-life announcement does not apply to Adobe Source Connectors, which are a data collection feature within Adobe Experience Platform. Adobe Source Connectors, occasionally referred to as Adobe Data Connectors, are fully supported by Adobe.

## Why did Adobe end-of-life this feature?

This feature was powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. The [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/experiencecloud.analytics.html#product) is now the place to find current integrations for Adobe solutions.

## How does removal of this feature impact you?

If you are an Adobe Partner, details on migrating your integration to the Adobe Exchange program can found at the [Adobe Technology Partner Program Support Center](https://adobeexchangeec.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003867071-Adobe-Analytics-Integration-Tools).  

If you are a Data Connector customer and want to request that the integration you use should be migrated, please route all requests directly to the integration partner. The partner must commit to moving to the new APIs. Adobe Customer Care cannot compel partners to move to the new APIs. Each company providing an integration was given the option to migrate their integration to Adobe Exchange or discontinue their integration.

Please reach out to Adobe Customer Care for questions or support.
