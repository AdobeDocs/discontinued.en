# Adobe Mobile Services end-of-life FAQ

Adobe Mobile Service's end-of-life date was **December 31, 2022**.

## What is happening?

Mobile Services reached end-of-life on December 31, 2022. Mobile Services, which supports a mobile-centric UI, acquisition, deep linking, in-app messaging, push notification, and geo-location is no longer supported after this date.

## What is included, and what is not included?

This end-of-life only includes Adobe Mobile Services, the standalone platform at [mobilemarketing.adobe.com](https://mobilemarketing.adobe.com). The Mobile version 4 SDKs that rely on this interface were sunset on August 31, 2021.

This end-of-life does NOT include Adobe Analytics for mobile apps, part of the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs. These features, which include in-app behavior, lifecycle analysis, messaging interaction tracking, and audience profiles, continue to receive support from Adobe.

## Why is the capability being retired?

As Adobe continues to expand its mobile marketing capabilities, features previously available in Mobile Services will be released in Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or offered through Adobe Exchange Premier Partners. This transition provides you with more powerful and flexible mobile marketing capabilities.

## What happens to existing processing rules created in Mobile Services?

[Processing rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/processing-rules/processing-rules.html) created or generated in the Mobile Services UI will automatically migrate to Adobe Analytics prior to the Mobile Services end-of-life date. Migrated processing rules behave similarly to other processing rules in Adobe Analytics, where you can freely view or edit them. No user action is required for this migration.

After Mobile Services is sunset, all processing rules logic will be handled exclusively within Adobe Analytics, typically including the use of [Context data variables](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/contextdata.html).

## What transition options are available?

Adobe offers three transition paths depending on your organization's use case.

1. **In-app messaging and push notifications**: Adobe can transition your messaging workflows into Adobe Journey Optimizer. This product helps organizations optimize and personalize experiences across the entire customer journey, including mobile messaging.
1. **Acquisition and deep linking**: Acquisition and deep linking are offered through the Adobe Exchange Premier Partners program. Adobe's partnership team can make appropriate introductions to ensure that you find the solution that best fits your needs.
1. **Places Service**: Places Service provides complimentary geo-location capabilities. See the [Places Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/places/using/home.html).

## Where can I go if I have questions?

See the [Adobe Mobile Services end-of-life Spark page](https://spark.adobe.com/page/C6D30y09zaRpD/) for more information. Contact your Adobe representative with any additional questions.
